# Chess AI Project

This chess AI project was developed in January 2022 during my third year of liceo. The project implements a fully functional chess game with AI capabilities using modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Created the structure for the chess board and UI elements
- **CSS3**: Styled the chess board, pieces, and modals with a clean interface
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Implemented the game logic, chess rules, and AI algorithms

### Game Implementation
- **Chess Logic**: Full implementation of chess rules including special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
- **Game State Management**: Track of pieces, valid moves, captures, and game progression
- **Custom UI**: Built with pure CSS for the board, pieces, and modals

### Artificial Intelligence
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Implemented the classic minimax algorithm for the AI decision-making
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Enhanced the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficiency
- **Position Evaluation**: Created evaluation functions to assess board positions
- **Move Ordering**: Optimized search by evaluating promising moves first
- **Configurable Difficulty**: Allow setting different search depths for the AI

### Advanced Features
- **AI vs AI Mode**: Support for watching two AI players compete against each other
- **Customizable Piece Sets**: Classic chess piece designs with image assets
- **Game Controls**: Reset, undo, and game status tracking

## What I Learned

### Programming Concepts
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Implemented complex tree-search algorithms and efficient data structures
- **Game Theory**: Applied minimax concepts from game theory to create an intelligent opponent
- **Recursive Functions**: Used recursion effectively for the minimax algorithm implementation
- **Performance Optimization**: Learned techniques to make the AI calculations more efficient

### Web Development
- **Frontend Architecture**: Structured a complex single-page application with multiple components
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updated the user interface based on game state
- **Event Handling**: Managed user interactions with the game board
- **Responsive Design**: Created an interface that works across different screen sizes

### Software Engineering
- **Project Organization**: Structured code across multiple files for better maintainability
- **Debugging Techniques**: Developed skills for tracking down and fixing complex logical bugs
- **Problem Decomposition**: Broke down the chess game into manageable components
- **Git Version Control**: Used Git to track changes and manage development progress

### Chess-Specific Knowledge
- **Chess Rules Implementation**: Gained deep understanding of chess mechanics by coding them
- **Game State Evaluation**: Learned to assess chess positions and assign numerical values
- **Chess AI Techniques**: Explored methods used in chess engines like position evaluation and move generation

This project represents a significant milestone in my programming journey, combining theoretical knowledge of algorithms with practical web development skills to create a complete, playable chess game with AI capabilities.
